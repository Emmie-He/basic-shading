# Basic Shading

Displays a circular shape that is shaded using the Phong Illumination Model.
The skeleton was from [Fall 2016 UC Berkeley CS184/284A Foundations of Computer Graphics](ps://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs184/fa16/assignments.html)

## Command Line Options
* -ka r g b
    * This is the ambient color coefficients of the sphere material. The parameters r g b are numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive.
* -kd r g b
    * This is the diffuse color coefficients of the sphere material. The parameters r g b are numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive.
* -ks r g b
    * This is the specular color coefficients of the sphere material. The parameters r g b are numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive.
* -spu pu
    * This is the power coefficient on the specular term in the u direction for an anisotropic material. It is a number between 0 and max_float.
* -spv pv
    * This is the power coefficient on the specular term in the v direction for an anisotropic material. It is a number between 0 and max_float.
* -sp p
    * This is the power coefficient on the specular term for an isotropic material. It is a number between 0 and max_float. (i.e. the same as setting pu and pv the the same value.)
* -pl x y z r g b
    * This adds a point light to the scene. The x y z values are the location of the light. The r g b values are it's color. Note that the x y z values are relative to the sphere. That is, the center of the sphere is at the origin and the radius of the sphere defines one unit of length. The Y direction is UP, the X direction is to the right on the screen, and the Z direction is "in your face." The r g b value are between 0 and max_float, NOT between 0 and 1 (that is, the r g b values encode the brightness of the light).
* -dl x y z r g b
    * This adds a directional light to the scene. The x y z values are the direction that the light points in. The r g b values are it's color.
* -asm
    * Ashikhmin-Shirley materials
